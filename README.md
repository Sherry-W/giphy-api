# GifTastic

### Overview
 
In this assignment, we were asked to use the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of our choice. To finish this task, we must call the GIPHY API and use JavaScript and jQuery to change the HTML of our site.

### My Theme

Disney Movies and/or Characters.

### How It Works

* When the user clicks on a button, the page should grab 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page.

* When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif should animate. If the user clicks the gif again, it should stop playing.

* Under every gif, display its rating (PG, G, so on).
   * This data is provided by the GIPHY API.

* User can input values from an input box and adds the button on the page.

* User can request additional gifs to be added to the page.
   * Each request should ADD 10 gifs to the page, NOT overwrite the existing gifs.
